# Detecting_Parkinsons_Disease
Detecting Parkinson's disease using the UCI ML Parkinson dataset.

The HealthCare sector has become increasingly reliant on data science because it allows the detection of a disease early on. This project takes the UCI ML Parkinson dataset and uses XGBoost (in Python) to learn when Parkinsons is detected and trains with that information. Then with the testing set, the model attempts to predict the presence of Parkinson's disease.

All steps are outlined in: *Detecting Parkinsonâ€™s Disease.ipynb*

Data is located in: *parkinsons.data* or can be found at [this website](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/parkinsons/telemonitoring/)
